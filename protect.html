        <h2>Too Good to Be True</h2>
        <p>Many Phishers present deals that seem to be unreasonably good to draw your attention to them. An example of this may be them saying that you won a lottery and just need to pay a fee for it to be sent to your account. Remember if a deal seems too good to be true.

            <h2>Sense of Urgency</h2>
            <p>A common tactic for Phishers is a sense of urgency that encourages you to listen to them now. This makes it easier for you to miss small hints that may not be a legitimate encounter. Some may say that you need to input your credit card details in the next 5 minutes or you won't be able to claim the $30000 you just won.</p>

            <h2>Hyperlinks</h2>
            <p>The text that a link displays is not always the url that it brings you to. Hover over a link to check where it will bring you. Phishers often use tactics to disguise the like like using a r and n to make something that looks like a m but brings you to another location like BankofArnerica.com</p>

            <p>If an email comes with an unexpected attachment dont open it. Most file types can be dangerous one way or another. The only fully safe file type is .txt.</p>
